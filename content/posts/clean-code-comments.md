Comments are a necessary evil. If programming languages were expressive enough, or our code perfectly descriptive, we would not need comments. Alas, we still need to write comments to explain just what our code meant to do.

## The Good

* Comments do not make up for bad code.
* Explain yourself in code.
* Make comments informative as in providing more detail to the reader of the code.
* Explaining intent in the comment can prove to be useful.
* Clarify ambiguous code, like the one using a library.
* Todo comments are a temporary comment used to inform the programmer of remaining work.
* Comments can be used to warn of side effects or importance of specific details.
* Javadocs for public APIs are extremely helpful.

## The bad

* Avoid confusing comments and redundant comments.
* Avoid misleading the reader.
* Avoid noise comments such as labeling things that are obvious from simply reading the code.
* Avoid commented out code!
* Avoid comments that provide too much information.
